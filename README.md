# Java binary transfer network
## Description
- This is a client/server based application that has a custom protocol to transafer aany data from **A** to **B** while the amount of data stays irrelevant.
- This is actually more a library then a then an application. It is advised to use the Server and Client classes to build the application one is aiming for.
- The client and server branches are only minimal examples of how a the communication between these can look like.
